        <p>A little about me. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I left for a short stint and headed to Southern California where I attended Pitzer College for 4 years. I discovered coding a little over a year ago. My friend was designing an app and I was filled with curiosity about this mystery language that I knew nothing about. As a linguaphile, I was teeming with questions. I speak Nepali, French, and Spanish, and am always eager to learn more. I asked about how my friend coded the app, and within a few minutes he stopped and said "okay, are you bored yet?" Apparently that was the reaction that he generally received. Needless to say, I was not bored--au contraire--I was fascinated. </p>
        <p>From that point forward I started learning to code. A little Python here, a little HTML there, and I was hooked. However, I am the type of person who benefits from working with other people, and coding by myself was not working to my benefit. I would get stuck on a problem and just stare at the screen forever, waiting to figure it out, and then would eventually have to resign from the code. So I decided to apply to coding schools. I applied to Ava Developers in Seattle, and to Hackbright Academy in San Francisco. I loved the idea of women coding together, as I am passionate about equal rights, equal opportunity, and increasing females in tech. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I didn't get into either school. Despite my devastation, I continued to learn. I live my life with a growth mindset, and I think this makes me a very good student. I try not to get discouraged or down on myself, and I just "hack" away at the problem. I took the Primer Course at Portland Code School, and now feel even more prepared and excited to jump into an intensive bootcamp. I am ready to learn. I think that I would make a great addition to the Epicodus community, and would love to learn from you all. </p>
